During my AI class at OSU we were often given code to use as a framework for projects.

For the Othello project that was assigned we were given a C++ library, and iirc a Java library as well.

I decided that this would not do and we absolutely needed a python library. So I turned a 3-4 hour project into a 10 hour one for no good reason.

Anyways here is the result of that. Use it for whatever you like if you happen to stumble upon it.
